# RAKSHAK - ITSP PROJECT

## AIM

To hit a target with a ball shooting mechanism, by determining its trajectory by tracking its movement using image processing.

This is just basic documentation for the code. The main documentation can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Wl19UZXrQKKP-T8rR-995h0s4oFzQRhIEcLIDzxxT8o)

### Prerequisites

* Arduino IDE
* C++
* python 2.7 with a few libraries like pyserial
* OpenCV (we used 3.2)

### How to run it?

* **The three files are:**
    * processing.cpp
    * cpparduinobridge.py
    * step_control.ino (placed in the folder)


* Make sure you have a working installation of OpenCV
* Load the .ino code onto the arduino and ensure that it is connected to the laptop
* Connect all the necessary wired to the arduino. The connections can be infered from the pinmodes in the code and the main documentation√Ç
